## Introduction

The ATmega16 microcontroller is used to generate PWM signals to control the speed of a DC motor. PWM is a technique used to generate analog signals using digital means. In this project, PWM is used to vary the average voltage applied to the motor, thereby controlling its speed.

## Components

To build this project, you'll need the following components:

- ATmega16 microcontroller
- DC motor
- L293D motor driver IC
- External power supply (for the motor)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram

The circuit diagram for connecting the DC motor to the ATmega16 microcontroller using the L293D motor driver IC is as follows:
