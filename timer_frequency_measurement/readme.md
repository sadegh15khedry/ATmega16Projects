# Timer Frequency Measurement Project

This project demonstrates how to measure frequency using timers on the ATmega16 microcontroller.

## Overview

This project utilizes the Timer/Counter module of the ATmega16 microcontroller to measure the frequency of an input signal. It employs a specific method to calculate the frequency based on the timer's overflow.

## Features

- Frequency measurement using Timer/Counter module
- High accuracy measurement
- Adjustable prescaler for different frequency ranges

## Hardware Requirements

- ATmega16 microcontroller
- Crystal oscillator (optional)
- External signal source for frequency measurement

## Software Requirements

- AVR Studio or any compatible IDE
- WinAVR or any compatible AVR compiler toolchain


## Usage

1. Connect the ATmega16 microcontroller to the circuit according to the provided circuit diagram.
2. Compile and upload the firmware to the microcontroller.
3. Apply the input signal whose frequency you want to measure.
4. View the measured frequency on the output interface (e.g., LCD, serial monitor).
