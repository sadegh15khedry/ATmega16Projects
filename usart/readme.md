# USART Communication with ATmega16

This project demonstrates USART (Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter) communication using the ATmega16 microcontroller.

## Description

USART communication allows for serial data transmission and reception between the ATmega16 microcontroller and external devices such as computers, other microcontrollers, or peripherals.

## Components Used

- ATmega16 microcontroller
- MAX232 (or similar) level shifter for RS-232 communication
- Resistors
- Capacitors
- Breadboard


## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the provided code (`usart.c`) to your ATmega16 microcontroller using an AVR programmer.
3. Power up the circuit.
4. Establish communication with the ATmega16 microcontroller using a serial terminal on your computer or another microcontroller.

## Usage

- Configure the baud rate and other USART settings as required for your application.
- Use a serial terminal program on your computer to send and receive data to/from the ATmega16 microcontroller.
