## Introduction

The LM35 is a precision integrated-circuit temperature sensor whose output voltage is linearly proportional to the Celsius (centigrade) temperature. This project uses the LM35 sensor to measure the ambient temperature and display it on an LCD connected to the ATmega16 microcontroller.

## Components

To build this project, you'll need the following components:

- ATmega16 microcontroller
- LM35 temperature sensor
- 16x2 LCD display
- 10kÎ© potentiometer (for adjusting LCD contrast)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram

The circuit diagram for connecting the LM35 temperature sensor to the ATmega16 microcontroller and LCD display is as follows:
