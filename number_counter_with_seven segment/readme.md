## Introduction

The ATmega16 microcontroller is programmed to increment a counter and display the count on a seven-segment display. This project illustrates basic digital counting and interfacing with seven-segment displays.

## Components

To build this project, you'll need the following components:

- ATmega16 microcontroller
- Seven-segment display
- Resistors (for current limiting)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram

The circuit diagram for connecting the seven-segment display to the ATmega16 microcontroller is as follows:
