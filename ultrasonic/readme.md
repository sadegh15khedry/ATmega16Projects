# Ultrasonic Distance Measurement with ATmega16

This project demonstrates how to measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor with the ATmega16 microcontroller.

## Description

The ultrasonic sensor measures distance by emitting ultrasonic waves and calculating the time it takes for the waves to bounce back. This project utilizes the ATmega16 microcontroller to interface with the ultrasonic sensor and calculate the distance based on the time delay.

## Components Used

- ATmega16 microcontroller
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Resistors
- Capacitors
- Breadboard



## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the provided code (`ultrasonic.c`) to your ATmega16 microcontroller using AVR programmer.
3. Power up the circuit.
4. The ultrasonic sensor will start measuring distances.

## Usage

- Ensure that the ultrasonic sensor is properly positioned and oriented towards the object whose distance needs to be measured.
- The distance measurement will be displayed on the connected display or output device.
